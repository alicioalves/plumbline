# Diagnose

When invoked with $ARGUMENTS, match the described symptom against the decision tree below and route to the appropriate skill. If code paths are referenced, read them first to confirm the match before routing. This skill routes to other skills from Plumbline (https://github.com/tomymaritano/plumbline). It works best when the full collection is installed.

## Decision Tree

### 0. "It panics / the test is red / here is the stack"

The report is a wrong output, a panic, or a failing test. The question is where it may be fixed.

→ **fault-locality**: Name the function that made the bad value. Do not route this to a design lens.

### 1. "Something feels wrong but I can't say what"

The symptom is a general sense of unease with no concrete complaint.

→ **complexity-recognition**: Apply the three-symptom framework to locate the source.

### 2. "Simple changes require edits in many files"

Change amplification. Branch by cause:

- Shared knowledge is scattered across modules → **information-hiding** (look for leaked implementation details)
- Old abstractions no longer fit the current shape of the system → **code-evolution** (check whether the design has kept pace with requirements)
- Module boundaries cut across concerns instead of encapsulating them → **module-boundaries** (re-evaluate decomposition)

### 3. "This interface is awkward / too many parameters"

The interface exposes too much or forces callers to assemble details they shouldn't need.

- Implementation burden leaks upward → **pull-complexity-down** (push details below the interface)
- The abstraction mixes general infrastructure with special-case logic → **general-vs-special** (separate the two)
- The module is shallow. Interface cost rivals implementation cost → **deep-modules** (deepen the module)

### 4. "I can't name this thing"

Naming difficulty signals a design problem, not a vocabulary problem.

→ **naming-obviousness**: If the name can't be made obvious, the entity's responsibility is likely unclear.
→ Then **design-it-twice**: Consider alternative decompositions that yield nameable pieces.

### 5. "Errors everywhere / too many exceptions"

Exception surfaces are large, catch blocks are boilerplate or error paths obscure the normal path.

→ **error-design**: Apply define-errors-out and exception aggregation.

### 6. "Layers feel redundant / wrappers add nothing"

Pass-through methods, thin adapter classes or layers that exist only for "architecture."

→ **abstraction-quality**: Evaluate whether each layer provides a meaningful abstraction or just adds indirection.

### 7. "Comments are useless / missing / stale"

Comments restate code, are absent where needed or have drifted from the implementation.

→ **comments-docs**: Apply the four-category framework and contamination checks.

### 8. "Code was written under pressure"

Technical debt from tactical shortcuts. The concern is process, not a specific structural flaw.

→ **strategic-mindset**: Assess the tactical-vs-strategic balance.
→ Then **code-evolution**: Plan incremental improvement alongside current work.

### 9. "I know what's wrong, just fix it"

A review already named the problems (a red-flags or design-review report in the conversation, or findings the user lists) and the user wants the code changed.

→ **test-worth** if what they want fixed is the tests and no design report named production findings.
→ Otherwise **apply-fixes**: Apply the findings one at a time, with the tests run after each.

### 10. The complaint is about tests

What to write, what to keep, a test that breaks when the implementation changes, a mock, a private-method test, or missing tests on code that is about to change.

→ **test-worth**. Do not apply the four criteria here. That skill owns them.

## Multiple Symptoms

When the description maps to more than one root symptom, prioritize in this order:

A panic, a stack, or a red test (branch 0) goes to **fault-locality** before the items below.

0. **Tests** (symptom 10): If the thing being complained about is which tests to write or keep, route to **test-worth** first, even when the wording also sounds structural. `test-worth` hands back to a design lens if the defect is production structure. A failing test is branch 0, not this one.
1. **Structural** (symptoms 1–6): These address the shape of the code and have the highest design leverage.
2. **Process** (symptom 8): This addresses how work is done. Important but downstream of structure.
3. **Surface** (symptom 7): Comment/doc issues are often symptoms of deeper structural problems. Fixing structure first may resolve them.

Route to the highest-priority match first. Mention the secondary matches so the user can follow up.

## When There Is No Problem

A vague complaint doesn't mean the code is wrong. A complaint about the tests is branch 10 even when production shows none of those structural symptoms. Before routing, read the code. If it shows none of the symptoms in the tree (changes stay local, names fit, errors are handled where they belong, interfaces are simple), lead with that verdict: the design is sound. Then, if useful, say what the unease probably is instead (unfamiliar domain, a hard problem, a style preference) and offer at most one optional improvement, labeled as optional. Don't go looking for "what's bugging you" until you find something to restructure.

## Fallback

If the described symptom does not match any branch above, and the code does show concrete problems, fall back to **red-flags**: a systematic scan will surface concrete signals to diagnose from.

## Pull request signature

If this session opens a pull request, or updates the body of one it opened, end that body with a single line of the form `Plumbline-Skills: red-flags, deep-modules`. List the directory name of each Plumbline skill whose checks you actually ran, comma-separated, in the order you ran them, including this skill. That example is the shape, not a default list. If a `Plumbline-Skills:` line is already there, replace it. Do not add the line to commit messages, review comments, or a pull request you are only reviewing, and do not open a pull request just to add it.
